sbt-livescript
==============

sbt (0.13) plugin supporting [livescript][] files.

This sbt plugin allows to compile [livescript][] files to javascript.

It uses [npm][] (which is required to be installed) and the LiveScript package that comes with it. The LiveScript package will
be installed by the script, so the only requirement is to have [npm][] installed on your system.

Yet in beta stage.

Installation
------------

Currently the only way to install it is by publishing it locally running **publishLocal** in sbt console.

Basic Usage
-----------

In yout build definition file add the following:

```
import sbtlivescript.SbtLiveScriptPlugin._
import LiveScriptKeys._

seq(liveScriptSettings)
```

sbt-livescript will compile any [livescript][] file located under `src/main/livescript` into javascript files.

Configuration
-------------

Using with sbt-closure
----------------------

You can use *sbt-livescript* in conjuntion with [sbt-closure][], allowing you to use
the closure compiler with [livescript][] source files and optionally to mix them with javascriptÂ ones.

In order to use it, first you must add the [sbt-closure][] plugin along with the sbt-livescript one as follows in
 the *plugins.sbt* file:

```
addSbtPlugin("com.logikujo" % "sbt-livescript" % "0.1")

addSbtPlugin("org.scala-sbt" % "sbt-closure" % "0.1.4")
```

The next step is to configure the sbt-livescript plugin to output javascript compiled files under a directory that
 can be reached by [sbt-closure][] and then let [sbt-closure][] closure task to run the livescript task, you can do this
 adding the following to your *build.sbt* file:

```
import sbtlivescript.SbtLiveScriptPlugin._
import LiveScriptKeys._
import sbt._
import sbtclosure.SbtClosurePlugin._

seq(liveScriptSettings)

seq(closureSettings)

version := "0.1"

(outputDirectory in (Compile, livescript)) := (sourceDirectory in (Compile, ClosureKeys.closure)).value / "ls"

(ClosureKeys.closure in Compile) := ((ClosureKeys.closure in Compile) dependsOn (livescript in (Compile, livescript))).value
```

Now, you can reference your livescript files inside the javascript manifest file as follows:

```
# Some javascript file under lib directory
libs/foo.js

# livescript compiled  files
ls/myLiveScriptFile1.js
ls/myLiveScriptFile2.js
```
